                Reggie started his journey cutting hair in a shop right in Seattle, building his craft one fade at a time. As his skills and clientele grew, he found his own spot just outside the city in Tukwila — and The Gentlemen&apos;s Lounge Barbershop was born.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond the barber chair, Reggie is a fitness coach who trains kids, bringing the same discipline and energy from the gym to every cut. Old-school technique meets modern style — straight razors, hot towels, crisp fades, and sharp lineups.

                Whether you&apos;re here for a quick lineup or the full experience, you&apos;re family the moment you walk through the door.
